# Frontend Day 1 & 2 - Foundation + Game Loop Complete

## What We Built ✅

### Day 1 Foundation
- ✅ Frame SDK integration with proper meta tags
- ✅ Farcaster Quick Auth implementation  
- ✅ 4x4 grid displaying 16 puzzle items
- ✅ Click to select/deselect items with visual feedback
- ✅ Basic UI with responsive mobile design
- ✅ Game state management (loading, playing, won, lost, error)

### Day 2 Complete Game Loop
- ✅ Full backend API integration using exact routes from backend dev
- ✅ Real puzzle loading from `/api/puzzles/:id`
- ✅ Group submission validation via `/api/puzzles/:id/guess`
- ✅ Mistake tracking with 4-mistake limit
- ✅ Proper win/lose screens with game state
- ✅ Error handling and loading states
- ✅ Clean UI polish with animations

## Backend API Integration
Connected to all backend routes as specified in `BACKEND_DAY_1.md`:
- `GET /api/puzzles` - List puzzles
- `GET /api/puzzles/:id` - Get puzzle data
- `POST /api/puzzles/:id/guess` - Submit guess
- `POST /api/puzzles/:id/hint` - Get progressive hints
- `GET /api/user/me` - Auth endpoint

## Game Flow Working
1. Loads "Tech Giants" puzzle on startup
2. Players select 4 items and submit
3. Backend validates and returns correct/incorrect
4. Tracks mistakes and shows win/lose accordingly
5. Displays solved groups with categories
6. Full game loop functional

## ❌ MAJOR ISSUE: Progressive Hint System

**Problem**: The current progressive hint system is TERRIBLE UX and we hate it.

**Current Implementation**:
- Automatically shows hints when 2+ items from same group selected
- Clutters the UI with unwanted information
- Removes challenge and discovery from gameplay
- Makes the game feel hand-holdy and annoying

**Decision**: **KILLING THE HINT SYSTEM COMPLETELY FOR MVP**

We're removing all hint-related code from the frontend:
- No more hint API calls
- No more hint displays
- No more "waiting for hint" messages
- Clean, minimal UI focused on core gameplay

The backend still supports hints, but frontend will ignore them completely. Pure connections gameplay without training wheels.

## Next Steps for Day 3
- Remove all hint-related frontend code
- Focus on animation polish for group reveals
- Add shuffle functionality with actual randomization
- Improve visual feedback for correct/incorrect guesses
- Test with multiple puzzles
- Polish mobile responsiveness

## Technical Notes
- Using Vite dev server on localhost:5173
- Backend running on localhost:8787
- Frame meta tags configured for proper Farcaster integration
- Quick Auth working for authenticated users
- All puzzle data coming from backend (no hardcoded data)

**Bottom Line**: Day 2 MVP complete, game loop works perfectly, but progressive hints are getting the axe. Clean gameplay > hand-holding.
