2. **Enhanced Navigation System**
   - Use `/api/puzzles/:id/navigation` for proper prev/next
   - Add "5 of 15" position indicators
   - Implement puzzle picker menu from full puzzle list

3. **User Statistics Dashboard**
   - Integrate `/api/user/stats` for authenticated users
   - Display "Games: 12 | Won: 8 (66.7%) | Perfect: 3"
   - Add stats to win screen and profile section

## Demo Readiness

**For Stakeholder Demo:**
- Start on "Tech Giants" puzzle (relatable, clear categories)
- Demonstrate puzzle navigation (show variety)
- Show win celebration with perfect score
- Test incorrect guess animations
- Display mobile responsiveness

**Key Talking Points:**
